INSTALLATION

This project is structure is done based on the below link.

http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/topics/settings.html#pluggable-settings

copy the the files which starts with underscore to "openstack_dashboard/local/enabled"

and make sure gbp_ui is in importable location, either in .venv or in the openstack_folder.

NOTE:  group-based-policy-ui is not qualified as valid package name, so I created gbp_ui package inside this.
